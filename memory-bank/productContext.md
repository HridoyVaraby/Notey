# Product Context: Notey

## Why This Project Exists
Notey exists to address the common challenge of managing both tasks and notes in a single, unified application. Many existing solutions focus on either task management or note-taking, forcing users to switch between multiple applications to manage their productivity workflow. Notey aims to bridge this gap by providing a seamless experience for both tasks and notes.

## Problems Notey Solves

1. **Fragmented Productivity Tools**
   - Users often need to use separate applications for tasks and notes
   - Switching between applications disrupts workflow and reduces productivity
   - Information related to tasks is often stored in notes, making cross-referencing difficult

2. **Complexity in Organization**
   - Many task managers lack intuitive organization systems
   - Note-taking apps often lack structured task management capabilities
   - Users struggle to maintain a coherent system across different tools

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Information stored across multiple platforms is difficult to keep synchronized
   - Related tasks and notes are disconnected in separate applications
