# Active Context: Notey

## Current Work Focus
Completing the Notey project - a task manager and note-taking application with React frontend and MySQL database. The current focus is on finalizing the application by implementing proper error handling, improving form validation, refining UI styling with Tailwind CSS, and preparing for testing and deployment.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project requirements and architecture
- Established technical context and system patterns
- Set up React frontend project with Vite and TypeScript
- Installed necessary dependencies (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Configured Tailwind CSS for the project
- Updated index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
- Created basic page components (Login, Register, NotFound)
- Implemented task management components (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm)
- Completed note-taking components (NoteList, NoteItem, NoteForm)
- Created backend directory with Express server setup
- Configured MySQL database connection
- Created database models for User, Task, and Note
- Created database seed script for generating test data
- Implemented error handling utilities for API requests
- Created form validation utilities
- Added Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent UI styling
- Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions

## Next Steps
1. Implement unit testing for frontend components
2. Implement integration testing for API endpoints
3. Set up a local development environment
4. Prepare for production deployment
5. Consider implementing future enhancements:
   - Collaboration features
   - Calendar integration
   - Mobile application development
   - Advanced search and filtering capabilities

## Immediate Priorities
1. Finalize testing infrastructure
2. Document API endpoints
3. Optimize application performance
4. Ensure responsive design works on all devices
5. Prepare deployment documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React for frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implementing Node.js/Express backend with MySQL database
- Using JWT for authentication
- Following RESTful API design principles
- Implementing a component-based architecture for the frontend
- Using Sequelize as ORM for database operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component composition for UI building
- Container/Presentational pattern for React components
- MVC pattern for backend organization
- RESTful API design
- Normalized database schema

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project requires a balance between task management and note-taking features
- User experience should be seamless between the two main functionalities
- Data organization (tags, categories) should be consistent across tasks and notes
- Security considerations are important for user data protection
- Performance optimization will be crucial for a smooth user experience
