# Active Context: Notey

## Current Work Focus
Implementing the Notey project - a task manager and note-taking application with React frontend and MySQL database. The current focus is on developing the frontend components and integrating Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project requirements and architecture
- Established technical context and system patterns
- Set up React frontend project with Vite and TypeScript
- Installed necessary dependencies (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Configured Tailwind CSS for the project

## Next Steps
1. Update index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
2. Create basic component structure for the application
3. Implement user authentication system
4. Develop task management features
5. Implement note-taking functionality
6. Create the Node.js/Express backend
7. Configure MySQL database and create schema
8. Integrate frontend with backend API
9. Test the application

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React for frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implementing Node.js/Express backend with MySQL database
- Using JWT for authentication
- Following RESTful API design principles
- Implementing a component-based architecture for the frontend
- Using Sequelize as ORM for database operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component composition for UI building
- Container/Presentational pattern for React components
- MVC pattern for backend organization
- RESTful API design
- Normalized database schema

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project requires a balance between task management and note-taking features
- User experience should be seamless between the two main functionalities
- Data organization (tags, categories) should be consistent across tasks and notes
- Security considerations are important for user data protection
- Performance optimization will be crucial for a smooth user experience
