# Active Context: Notey

## Current Work Focus
Implementing the Notey project - a task manager and note-taking application with React frontend and MySQL database. The current focus is on completing the frontend components, particularly the note-taking functionality, and preparing for backend development.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project requirements and architecture
- Established technical context and system patterns
- Set up React frontend project with Vite and TypeScript
- Installed necessary dependencies (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Configured Tailwind CSS for the project
- Updated index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
- Created basic page components (Login, Register, NotFound)
- Implemented task management components (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm)
- Started implementing note-taking components (NoteList)

## Next Steps
1. Complete note-taking components (NoteItem, NoteForm)
2. Implement user authentication system with JWT
3. Create the Node.js/Express backend
4. Configure MySQL database and create schema
5. Implement API endpoints for tasks and notes
6. Integrate frontend with backend API
7. Test the application

## Immediate Priorities
1. Complete NoteItem.tsx component for individual note entries
2. Create NoteForm.tsx for adding new notes
3. Implement API calls for user authentication
4. Set up JWT token handling
5. Initialize Express backend server
6. Configure MySQL connection using provided credentials

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React for frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implementing Node.js/Express backend with MySQL database
- Using JWT for authentication
- Following RESTful API design principles
- Implementing a component-based architecture for the frontend
- Using Sequelize as ORM for database operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component composition for UI building
- Container/Presentational pattern for React components
- MVC pattern for backend organization
- RESTful API design
- Normalized database schema

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project requires a balance between task management and note-taking features
- User experience should be seamless between the two main functionalities
- Data organization (tags, categories) should be consistent across tasks and notes
- Security considerations are important for user data protection
- Performance optimization will be crucial for a smooth user experience
