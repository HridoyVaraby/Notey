# Active Context: Notey

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the Notey project - a task manager and note-taking application with React frontend and MySQL database. The initial focus is on setting up the project structure and implementing core functionality.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project requirements and architecture
- Established technical context and system patterns

## Next Steps
1. Set up the React frontend project structure
2. Create the Node.js/Express backend
3. Configure MySQL database and create schema
4. Implement user authentication
5. Develop core task management features
6. Develop note-taking functionality
7. Integrate frontend with backend API
8. Implement styling with Tailwind CSS
9. Test the application

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using React for frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implementing Node.js/Express backend with MySQL database
- Using JWT for authentication
- Following RESTful API design principles
- Implementing a component-based architecture for the frontend
- Using Sequelize as ORM for database operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component composition for UI building
- Container/Presentational pattern for React components
- MVC pattern for backend organization
- RESTful API design
- Normalized database schema

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project requires a balance between task management and note-taking features
- User experience should be seamless between the two main functionalities
- Data organization (tags, categories) should be consistent across tasks and notes
- Security considerations are important for user data protection
- Performance optimization will be crucial for a smooth user experience
