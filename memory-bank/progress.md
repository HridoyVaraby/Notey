# Progress: Notey

## What Works
- Memory bank structure has been initialized with all core files
- Project requirements and architecture have been defined
- Technical context and system patterns have been established
- React frontend project has been set up with Vite and TypeScript
- Required dependencies have been installed (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Tailwind CSS has been configured for the project

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend
- [x] Project setup with React
- [x] Update index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
- [x] Component structure implementation
- [x] User authentication UI (login/register)
- [x] Dashboard layout
- [x] Task management components
- [ ] Note-taking components
- [ ] Styling with Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- [ ] Express.js server setup
- [ ] API routes definition
- [ ] Authentication controllers
- [ ] Task controllers
- [ ] Note controllers
- [ ] Database models and migrations

### Database
- [ ] MySQL database setup
- [ ] Schema creation
- [ ] Seed data for testing

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend API
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Note CRUD operations

### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Local development environment
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## Current Status
Project is in active development phase. Frontend structure is complete with:
- Authentication pages (Login, Register)
- Dashboard layout with tab navigation
- Task management components (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm)
- NoteList component implemented

Next focus is completing note-taking components and starting backend development.

## Known Issues
No implementation issues yet as development has not started.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- React for frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Node.js/Express for backend
- MySQL for database
- JWT for authentication

### Future Considerations
- Potential for adding collaboration features
- Possible integration with calendar applications
- Mobile application development
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
