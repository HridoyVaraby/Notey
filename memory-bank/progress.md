# Progress: Notey

## What Works
- Memory bank structure has been initialized with all core files
- Project requirements and architecture have been defined
- Technical context and system patterns have been established
- React frontend project has been set up with Vite and TypeScript
- Required dependencies have been installed (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Tailwind CSS has been configured for the project

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend
- [x] Project setup with React
- [x] Update index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
- [x] Component structure implementation
- [x] User authentication UI (login/register)
- [x] Dashboard layout
- [x] Task management components
- [x] Note-taking components
- [x] Styling with Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- [x] Express.js server setup
- [x] API routes definition
- [x] Authentication controllers
- [x] Task controllers
- [x] Note controllers
- [x] Database models and migrations

### Database
- [x] MySQL database setup
- [x] Schema creation
- [x] Seed data for testing

### Integration
- [x] Connect frontend with backend API
- [x] Implement authentication flow
- [x] Task CRUD operations
- [x] Note CRUD operations

### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Local development environment
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## Current Status
Project is in active development phase. Both frontend and backend implementations are now complete with:

- Authentication pages (Login, Register)
- Dashboard layout with tab navigation
- Task management components (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm)
- Note management components (NoteList, NoteItem, NoteForm)
- Backend API for user authentication, tasks, and notes
- Frontend-backend integration for all CRUD operations

## Known Issues
- [x] Implemented proper error handling for API requests
- [x] Improved form validation
- [x] Refined UI styling with Tailwind CSS utility classes

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- React for frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Node.js/Express for backend
- MySQL for database
- JWT for authentication

### Recent Changes
- Implemented note and task controllers with CRUD operations
- Created API routes for notes and tasks
- Updated server.js to register the new routes
- Created frontend API service to connect with backend
- Updated frontend components to use the API service instead of mock data

### Future Considerations
- Potential for adding collaboration features
- Possible integration with calendar applications
- Mobile application development
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
