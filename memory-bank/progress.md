# Progress: Notey

## What Works
- Memory bank structure has been initialized with all core files
- Project requirements and architecture have been defined
- Technical context and system patterns have been established
- React frontend project has been set up with Vite and TypeScript
- Required dependencies have been installed (React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS)
- Tailwind CSS has been configured for the project

## What's Left to Build

### Frontend
- [x] Project setup with React
- [ ] Update index.css with Tailwind CSS directives
- [ ] Component structure implementation
- [ ] User authentication UI (login/register)
- [ ] Dashboard layout
- [ ] Task management components
- [ ] Note-taking components
- [ ] Styling with Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- [ ] Express.js server setup
- [ ] API routes definition
- [ ] Authentication controllers
- [ ] Task controllers
- [ ] Note controllers
- [ ] Database models and migrations

### Database
- [ ] MySQL database setup
- [ ] Schema creation
- [ ] Seed data for testing

### Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend API
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Note CRUD operations

### Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Local development environment
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## Current Status
Project is in the early development phase. Memory bank has been set up with all required documentation, and the React frontend project has been initialized with Vite and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS has been configured, and we're ready to start implementing the core components of the application.

## Known Issues
No implementation issues yet as development has not started.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- React for frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Node.js/Express for backend
- MySQL for database
- JWT for authentication

### Future Considerations
- Potential for adding collaboration features
- Possible integration with calendar applications
- Mobile application development
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
